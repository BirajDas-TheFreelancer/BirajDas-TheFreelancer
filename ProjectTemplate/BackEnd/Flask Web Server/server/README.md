# Docker 
	
	Usage : Containerization
	
	Details : Containerization is the packaging together of software code with all it’s necessary components like libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies so that they are isolated in their own "container."
		
	Benifit : the containerized application can be moved and run consistently in any environment and on any infrastructure, independent of that environment or infrastructure’s operating system. The container acts as a kind of bubble or a computing environment surrounding the application and keeping it independent of its surroundings. It’s basically a fully functional and portable computing environment.
