			Spring Dataâ€™s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data 
			access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.

			It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce 
			frameworks, and cloud-based data services. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects 
			that are specific to a given database. The projects are developed by working together with many of the 
			companies and developers that are behind these exciting technologies.

			Features :
			
				-> Powerful repository and custom object-mapping abstractions

				-> Dynamic query derivation from repository method names

				-> Implementation domain base classes providing basic properties

				-> Support for transparent auditing (created, last changed)

				-> Possibility to integrate custom repository code
